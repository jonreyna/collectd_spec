Conventional network automation projects are typically built using an isolated
development lifecycle. In part, that isolation is desireable to free new 
implementations from the design limitations of other projects. However, that 
flexibility comes at a cost: effort duplication.

Effort duplication is clearly salient in data collection code required by most 
applications. Isolated development lifecycles make sharing data with other
applications an afterthought. As a result, new projects inevitably duplicate 
data, compute, maintenance, and programming efforts. 

This paper outlines a way to eliminate effort duplication by adapting a 
well-established architectural pattern to the to the existing development 
lifecycle. The pattern works by consolidating homogenous logic into processes 
that make their data available to client applications. Collectd is an instance 
of this pattern.
